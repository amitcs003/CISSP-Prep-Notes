# CISSP-Prep-Notes
My first recommendation to all who are preparing for this exam is that don't read the books just for the sake of it. The key to your success in the exam will be to understand the process and why we are doing it. Please pay very close attention to most important process like SDLC (800-64), BCP-DRP (800-34), IR, Configuration Management (800-128), ISCM (800-137) and Security Assessments (800-53). You do not need to read the entire documents. Restrict your reading to "Introduction", "Fundamentals" and process steps.

1. Sybex (8/10): This is a must read but unfortunately this is not sufficient enough. You need to supplement your study plan with NIST docs and other sources. I don't even remember how many times I might have read it cover to cover (atleast thrice) to reinforce the concepts (yes I'm a slow learner).

2. SNT Subscription (10/10): SNT videos are great. Luke records these videos with an assumption that the audience has zero knowledge on this respective concept and hence starts it from scratch. I think it really helps for first timers like me. The questions are extremely hard and force you to think to the core.

3. 11th Hour (8/10): A good read toward the end for quick revision.

4. Madunix Process Guide (10/10): A must read to reinforce all the steps involved.

5. Destination Certification (10/10): Rob Witcher and John Berti have done a commendable job here. These videos help you paint a bigger picture and how everything you studied gels together.

6. Thor's Practice Questions (9/10): These are easy but then they help you in instilling the concepts in your mind.

7. Wentz's QOTD (10/10): Thee questions have been very carefully crafted. They again make you think and you need to pick keywords from the questions and answer based on precisely what has been asked.

8. Cissprep.net (11/10): This worked the best for me as far practice questions are concerned. Super vague questions and very similar to what you see on the exam. Very affordable too.

Some key tips -

1. No amount of memorization will help. Try to understand the process.

2. Its good to know the key lengths, cable types, etc but please avoid spending too much time on these. You may hardly see these on the exam. The exam itself is very process based.

3. I wouldn't have passed if I had not followed NIST docs (key ones already mentioned above).

All the very best, you got it!
